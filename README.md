## Welcome to the Variant Association Tools (VAT) tutorial session at ISMB 2018

To run the live demo as I'll be doing at the tutorial session, you need two software packages:

1. [SoS Notebook](https://vatlab.github.io/sos-docs/#Documentation)
2. [docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)

Notice that to gaurantee the best learning experience, our software tool, [VAT](http://varianttools.sourceforge.net/Main/Documentation), is pre-installed to a docker image we'd like to use for the tutorial session, although you are also welcome to follow VAT documentation and install VAT locally on your computer.
